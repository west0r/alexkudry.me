        aboutDescription: "Hi, I’m Alexey Kudryavtsev. I’ve been in IT since 2014, in management since 2019, and in consulting since 2021. Currently, I’m the Engineering Manager of the CI/CD mobile applications team at inDrive.\n\nI have a strong technical background, experience working at Avito and inDrive, leadership in conferences like Mobius and Podlodka Crew, and projects focused on transforming engineering culture in large companies.\n\nMy experience helps engineers and team leads handle stress, face professional challenges, and develop sustainable work approaches for long-term success. I assist those who want to achieve their goals at work and in their careers by relying on proven and effective methods rather than cargo cults.",
